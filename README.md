# Ensemble-learning-deep-beam

Ensemble learning is proven to have better performance than individual learning. Ensemble methods integrate several weak learners that are generated by the individual learning algorithms into a strong one according to some specific rules, thus they usually have higher performance and generalization ability than that of the weak learners. To this end, this work presents four typical ensemble machine learning models such as random forest, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to obtain the predictive model for RC deep beams with/without web reinforcements. Meanwhile, the ensemble model is also compared with the traditional mechanics-driven models and demonstrates great superiority. The importance and impact of each feature on the shear strength are also analyzed.
